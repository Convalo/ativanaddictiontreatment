              <h2><strong>ATIVAN ADDICTION TREATMENT: YOU WILL NEED SUPPORT</strong></h2>
              <p>How many times in our lives have we been warned not to do something without the assistance of others? </p>
              <p>Like learning to drive on our own without knowing the first thing about how to operate a <br>
                vehicle?</p>
              <p>Or how to cook an entire Thanksgiving dinner despite the fact that we don&rsquo;t know how to turn on the kitchen oven? </p>
              <p>In short, yes, help is needed in these circumstances.</p>
              <p>And of course, there are other circumstances in which help is needed, drug addiction being one of them.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">Ativan</a> addiction treatment entails drug recovery <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">from a substance</a> that you will (and more-than-likely should) seek out medical assistance with.</p>
              <p>This means while you&rsquo;re detoxing and going through recovery, there&rsquo;s a strong chance <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/withdrawal-sickness-just-bad">withdrawal may occur</a>, if not properly treated, can set back your rehabilitation. Or, at least, make it quite dangerous should you attempt detox and recovery on your own, or with someone who isn&rsquo;t qualified to assist patients who are detoxing and recovering.              </p>
              <h2><strong>HOW TO TELL SYMPTOMS OF ATIVAN WITHDRAWALS</strong></h2>
              <p>There are quite a few ways to tell when someone is going through Ativan withdrawals, none of which are particularly safe to face on one&rsquo;s own.</p>
              <p>Common emergencies <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/substance-abuse-treatment-centers-numbers">during detox and rehabilitation</a> from Ativan addiction include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Anxiety and nausea that can be due to the drug no longer calming the user. They are now anxious and scattered, which can lead to psychological, emotional and physical stress.</li>
                <li>A need to increase the dosage of their Ativan because they&rsquo;ve built up tolerance to the drug.</li>
                <li>Cravings, which are known as the true sign of the psychological aspect of Ativan addiction. With cravings, you or your loved one&rsquo;s mind is affixed to Ativan and little else. Cravings are at their worst during initial withdrawal, and can include:              </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Headache</li>
                  <li>Sweating</li>
                  <li>Trembling and shaking</li>
                  <li>Muscle spasms</li>
                  <li>Dizziness</li>
                  <li>Nausea</li>
                  <li>Rapid heart rate</li>
                  <li>Loss of appetite              </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <h2><strong>YOU KNOW THEY&rsquo;RE SUFFERING. SO BREAK ASSISTED REHAB TO THEM NICELY</strong></h2>
              <p>Some people simply give up in the wake of rehabilitation and those who can help them through the rehab process. The addicted individual sees this as a way out of their misery, and a process to get their lives back on track.</p>
              <p>The ones who don&rsquo;t give up so quickly may have a strong sense of pride to themselves, particularly with their addiction. In short, they got themselves into this mess, and just as shortly, they&rsquo;ll get themselves out and on the road to recovery.</p>
              <p>These are the sort of addicts that a friend or loved one should worry about. If you encounter a person such as this, and especially if they&rsquo;re addicted to a drug such as Ativan, there is a good chance they can benefit much more, and more safely, with Ativan addiction treatment within an accredited facility run by an accredited staff of addiction professionals.</p>
              <p>Break this fact to your friend or loved one gently. It&rsquo;s already hard on them, knowing they&rsquo;re now a drug addict, plain and simple. Recovery can be just as difficult. </p>
              <p>Tell the one you care for to be safe, thorough, and complete in their tasks with detox and rehabilitation, and recovery can become a strong and obtainable outcome.</p>
